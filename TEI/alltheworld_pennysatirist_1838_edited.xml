            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading increasingly common and inexpensive.</p>
            <p>The corpus holds 36 individual documents, which reflect a diverse mix of reporting on
               various hauntings in and around London between 1804 and 1889. The PDF and JPEGs from
               online databases were transcribed using ABBYFineReader OCR, then corrected and
               occasionally manually transcribed if document quality necessitated it. After
               normalization in plain text, all documents were upconverted to TEI XML.</p>

               <p>Earlier texts have had some spelling normalization due to errors in OCR.
                  Typographic em dashes are longer than modern em dashes, so all dashes have been

      <body>
         <p>All the world has by this time heard of the <placeName ref="london">London</placeName> Ghost, who is known in the suburbs,
            by the name of <q>Spring-heeled Jack,</q> who has been jumping Jim Crow in our neighbourhood
            in rather a novel style. Various conjectures are afloat respecting this solemn, grave
            looking personage. Some say it is Spring Rice, who has taken this opportunity of
            diverting the minds of the people from political scrutiny, and financial investigations.
            Others again say it is Jack Russell, on the <rs ref="pol">secret service of the Home Department</rs>;
            others, Lord Brougham, looking for glow-worms to enlighten the people. We cannot say we
            agree with any of these popular rumours. We have too much faith in ghosts, to doubt the
            possibility of its being a <soCalled>genevine bony fidy</soCalled> spirit incarnate, sent from Tartar-us to
            warn the sinful inhabitants of this land of the coming judgments of the Devil, for their
            awful selfishness and grasping greediness, by which they suck the blood of the poor, and
            fasten upon the produce of their industry, with their savage claws. The rumours that
            prevail about a wager between some wealthy scamps of aristocracy are much too
            imaginative and incredible for our sober minds. <note ana="generalized-fictional">Who the d—e could make hoots for a
            sham-apparition that would enable the wearer to jump over garden walls and fly over the
            tops of houses, to ride across the weathercocks of churches and to peep in at the back
            window of a house at the very moment he was knocking at the front door, and frightening
            the maid into her inward senses?</note> This is an age of discovery, truly; but science has not
            yet ascended to such an altitude as this amongst the honourable corporation of snobs, on
            whose shoulders the whole guilt of this wonderful apparition is very unjustly laid.</p>
         <p>The ghost is generally about the size of a man, but it takes various forms. Sometimes it
            has the shape of a bear, sometimes it jumps like a kangaroo, and very frequently it is
            <rs ref="rel">dressed like one of the knights of Jerusalem</rs>, in shining bright armour, which gleams
            with a white light, like phosphorus. We saw a man who told us that, being at <placeName>Ilford</placeName> one
            day, he met a man who told him that he had fallen in with a woman who positively assured
            him that she knew a girl who had fairly lost her old wits by the sight of the ghost, and
            had been provided with a new set of wits so entirely different that it was hard to
            believe she was the same person. A servant girl in <placeName ref="#kensington">Kensington</placeName>, we are informed, has been
            so powerfully affected that her person has swelled so enormously that her mistress has
            dismissed her as unfit for household work.</p>
         <p>A gentleman in <placeName ref="#hammersmith">Hammersmith</placeName> has horns growing on his head, which are generally supposed
            to be produced by one of Springheeled Jack’s incantations. But the strangest rumour of
            all is this, that the present hard frost is owing to the immense consumption of heat by
            the apparition, which, having lately left the furnace underneath presented such an
            attraction to the fiery element above, that he has absorbed it all for his own private
            satisfaction, leaving us to experience the same shivering sensation which he felt
            himself when he came up amongst us.</p>
         <p>We have been privately informed that there are <rs ref="pol rel" ana="researchme">Thugs in England; and several in Ireland;
            and that the Thugs in Ireland have joined the Trades’ Associations, and are privately
            proselytizing the sons of Erin to the worship of Kalee.</rs> This report, which is believed
            in certain circles, has probably given rise to the rumour, which we lately heard
            repeated by a respectable gentleman, that Springheeled Jack was a Thug. It is well known
            that the Thugs pride themselves in killing without shedding blood. The Irish do not
            understand this doctrine. <rs ref="or" ana="wow this is like doubly racist">It seems so unnatural. The Thugs have, therefore, experienced
            considerable difficulty in the Green Isle in propagating their principles.</rs> In this
            country it seemed impossible to pursue their favourite system of social amelioration, on
            account of the vigilance of the police. They, therefore, so says the report, have
            resorted to this ghostly method of sacrificing to their favourite Kalee, the goddess of
            bloodless death.</p>
         <p>We have no faith in this idle tale; but we can assure our readers that we have heard,
            from a respectable quarter, that a woman has brought forth a child with horns on its
            head, and sharp-pointed nails on its fingers. <rs ref="pol" ana="poorlaw">The father swears it is not his, and the
            wife quotes the Poor Law Amendment Bill to prove that it is.</rs>
            </p>
         <p>
                <rs ref="pol">We hope the Bishop of London is exercising his ghostly jurisdiction in the diocese.
            Mayhap this Springheeled Jack is the doctor himself. Darkness is the natural element of
            a Bishop. No man burneth a candle in daylight. And as Bishops’ are candles, they are
            made only for dark times, and dark places, being entirely extinguished when the broad
            glare of the day-star beams upon them. Bishops were very luminous in the dark ages.
            Now-a-days one can scarcely see them. They are like fires which the sun-beams have
            played upon. It is natural enough that these men should desire to restore their ghostly
            influence over men’s minds. But it requires an original genius to discover and put in
            practice the true and only method.</rs> Blomfield is an enterprising <emph>spirited</emph> fellow, and
            has a large fraternity of ghostly attendants, whose services he can at all times command
            to carry out his spiritual plans of ecclesiastical government. Now the ghost is
            evidently a combination of individuals. It is seen in Kensington, Hammersmith, Ilford,
            Pockham, Highgate, and Greenwich, at one and the same time. The most natural inference,
            therefore, is that it is a clerical man[oe]uvre. The churches, we understand, have been
            rather better attended on account of it, and we ourselves have heard of one woman who
            was so frightened that she went to church on Sunday last to charm away the evil one from
            herself and children, who had not been in church for twelvemonths previous.</p>
         <p>But how to account for the <emph>springing</emph> is difficult. There is something beyond flesh and
            blood, and clerical manœuvring, in this. There must be a real ghost in pay somehow.
            This we are told is now not so difficult as it has been for a century or two. Astrology
            is reviving. We know several sorcerers in London, and one man assured us that he has
            raised hosts of devils, and made them sit till he drew their pictures. He also showed us
            the picturea of several, and amongst the rest <emph>Cashiel</emph> riding on a dragon, a fierce
            looking fellow. He brings them up in a glass, but he thinks it not impossible for a
            parson to make them move about in the open air.</p>
         <p>Now the girl at Ilford swears that she saw the moon through the ghost’s head.</p>
         <p>The Lord Mayor has received several important letters on the subject, and promises to do
            his utmost to throw light upon it. But it ain’t arsenic candles, we can assure his
            Lordship, that will remove an evil so disastrous as this. The fact is, some people
            ascribe it wholly to the arsenic candles. One servant girl, on opening a door, had the
            flame of the candle blown in her face. She fainted, and fell on the floor; and when she
            recovered, she said she saw a man with an owl’s face, all covered with feathers, from
            head to foot. The doctor gave her a turn out, and she is as well as ever; but the candle
            being examined, it was found to be a wax-end— perhaps one of the Lord Mayor’s best. If
            the spirit of arsenic has actually been embodied and personified, it will be a
            heavy crime for the chandlers to answer for. The bar, in our opinion, is more suitable
            than the bench for such gentlemen.</p>
         <p>But two lawyers have kindly offered their services to lay this devil. The Lord Mayor is
            highly gratified with this promised aid. If a lawyer cannot lay the devil, he has little
            faith in a parson. But his Lordship is no Christian to talk thus. “If satan cast out
            satan, how can his kingdom stand ?” It is another manœuvre to inveigle tho public.
            Better employ Joseph Ady at once to hunt it down—or to raise a subscription to lay it.
            We have no doubt that Joseph would make a good job of it, with the Lord Mayor’s forged
            seal attached to his Commission. But we must pause for want of space. Our friend
            M‘Dougal, is out after this son of the mist, and most probably will make important
            discoveries.</p>
