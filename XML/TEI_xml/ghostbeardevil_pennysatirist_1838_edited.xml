            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading common and inexpensive.</p>

         <p>A ghost, a bear, or a devil—for it seems not to be settled, which—has been going the
            round of <placeName ref="amb">the suburbs of the metropolis</placeName>, frightening nursery maids into fits, and ladies
            into hysterics, and as far as its antics have yet been played, with perfect impunity.
            <placeName ref="#kew">Kew</placeName> is one of the places named as the scene of its pranks, probably from the reputation
            of one of its late residents. Had not King Ernest gone to <placeName ref="irr">Hanover</placeName>, never, we trust, to
            come back, we could easily have accounted for the demon's appearance in that quarter.
