A Ghost!

The other evening a young lady had occasion to go homewards down one of the lanes leading from the Building-hill. The night was moderately dark, and misses head was full of witches, ghosts, worrikows, bogles, and long-beaked indescribables. At a particular point, she noted a veritable ghost, and set up such a scream as awakened all the echoes in the neighbourhood, and very deaf ones they are, and fainted away.—Several parties, deeming murder had been committed, ran to the spot, and found miss prostrate, and the cause of her fright —a white ass, mumbling its scanty supper, drawn from the hedge. She is not yet convinced that she did not see a spirit, and has been very ill since. If young ladies fainted away at the sight of every ass frequenting these lanes, by day as well as by night, burnt feathers would be at a premium.—Sunderland Herald.
