                <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
                    the 18th and 19th century British newspapers and periodicals. The project explores
                    the beginnings of mass print media in metropolitan areas at a time when technology
                    and education made reading for pleasure common and inexpensive.</p>

            <body><p>There is one of the most remarkable personifications— if such a term may be
            allowed— of a <rs ref="#ghost">Ghost</rs>, in the singular story of <q>The Robber,</q> which has just appeared
            from the pen of <name type="publication">Blackwood's</name> well-known contributor. The schemes of the Robber are most
            ingeniously and naturally contrived to depend, for their fulfillment, almost upon a
            miracle; and it is <rs type="hoax">the phantom-stratagem</rs> which he practices, that most marvelously works
            out his security, and eventually his doom.</p>
