            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading common and inexpensive.</p>

         <p>﻿Just now, while we are preparing to meet possible foes by land and water, if Nelson’s
            Ghost were to appear amongst us, would be not be welcomed? Assuredly he would be
            preferred for the command of the Channel fleet even to Lord John Russell. But what would
            be the first thing that would strike his eye? It would be an advertisement in the
            papers, declaring, that to this day, the daughter whom he left as a legacy to his
            country, is unprovided for; that even now, having reached the maturity of life, and
            struggled with difficulties, she is still a creditor of the country he served so
            faithfully!</p>
         <p>Her claim, indeed, has been recognised by the gift of a paltry place to one of her
            sons—a bare provision for the young man. It is a recognition enough to stamp the
            obligation of the state with the royal admission, but not to fulfil it.</p>
         <p>Would Nelson on that account refuse to take the command even at the risk of dying over
            again? Assuredly not. He would repeat his simple and immortal precept, <q>England expects
            every man to do his duty,</q> even though England has shown so disgracefully how little she
            can understand her own duty.</p>
