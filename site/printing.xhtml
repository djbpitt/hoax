        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>My first Sunday in London was spent in Cambridge, where Nick Smith, a retired
                Cambridge University librarian and printing enthusiast, gave me a tour of one of the
                few remaining print shops in the country. <a
                    href="http://www.museumoftechnology.com/visit/">The Cambridge Museum of
                    Technology</a> is housed in Cambridge's old pumping station, where sewage was
                pumped away from the town to Milton.</p>
            <p>Though the information Nick gave me is well-documented in technological histories,
                his expertise on how machines worked, who could use them, and the design intention
                behind them made the experience singular. I was able to ask Nick to take me through
                the process of publishing a daily newspaper or periodical, from hand setting type to
                pressing proofs to inking to printing. As students of literature, I think we often
                fail to consider the physical realities of documents. Though archival research
                emphasizes the materiality of the text, I have always been encouraged to think about
                the life of the book after it reached its owner. In the case of newsprint, the life
                of the text before it was sold has bearing upon the meaning of the text itself, but
                its life ends as soon as it is read. As someone who aims to become a digital
                text-based scholar, I want to understand the materiality of my texts, even if I am
                unable to present them in analysis.</p>
            <p>Here I will take you through the steps as Nick explained them, with some help from
                the museum's guidebook and date verification from U of Texas' <a

            <h2>Typesetting</h2>
            <p>Some of the largest advancements in printing technology took place in typesetting in
                the 1880s, with the invention of linotype and monotype setting. Until then,
                broadsheets were set by hand, in lines.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Nick explained that the particular challenge of hand composition was justifying text,
                a process we take advantage of with modern word processing. After the invention of
                the Ludlow and linotype, hand typesetting, which was tedious and difficult, became
                much less common. Ludlow machines still required handsetting, but of moulds rather
                than actual text. After setting text, the printer then poured molten metal into the
                mould, to be used for newspaper titles and headlines. With the linotype, a printer
                could key the copy into a machine. The machine would drop unique keys, which
                contained the outline of the letter, into something similar to a composing stick.
                When a line was complete, the printer would pour molten metal into the cast, forming
                a line of text which could then be set in the frame.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The monotype machine was an improvement upon the linotype machines, as any small
                mistake meant a whole line was useless. Monotype allowed a printer to replace
                individual characters or words with ease, cutting proofing time down significantly.
                These machines were not invented until the 1880s, which meant printing remained a
                specialized skill, as typesetting took an expert eye.</p>
            <p>After a frame was set, a printer would create a proof to ensure all text was accurate
                and correctly justified. After corrections were made, the frame could be used for
                printing.</p>

            <h2>Printing</h2>
            <p>Nick emphasized that the real progress in mechanized printing occured in 1814, when
                steam-powered presses came into wide use. This automation increased output to nearly
                200 sheets per hour. Later developments included the cylinder press in 1832, which
                was particularly useful for newspaper printing. Rather than waste energy on opening
                and closing a press, paper was rolled through the press, where an inked curved plate
                printed the text. To create these curved plates, the plate was coated with papier
                mache, creating a flexible impression called a flong. Later, flongs were made of dry
                paper, which eliminated the need for drying time. Flongs were then used to create a
                metal plate, which was attached to a cylinder press. Though the extra step of
                creating a flong added time and effort to the process, the cylinder press's ability
                to quickly make single broadsheets more than made up for it.</p>

            <h2>Distribution and Industry</h2>
            <p>Distribution depended on the publication, but Nick emphasized the status of printers
                during the nineteenth century. Regardless of what they printed, it was considered a
                respectable profession. While manual labor was needed to operate certain machines,
                the mechanization of the printing process merely increased demand. Printed material
                became cheaper, information more diverse, and those publishing material became
                wealthier.</p>
