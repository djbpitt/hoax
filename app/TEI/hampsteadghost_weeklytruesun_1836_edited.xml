               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the

         <p>﻿It will be recollected that about a fortnight since Mr. Sutton, a respectable
            solicitor residing at <placeName ref="#hampstead">Hampstead</placeName>, was brought to this office in custody of the S division
            of police, on a charge of having assaulted two of the constables, under the following
            curious circumstances:— It appeared that a tall figure in a white mantle had been seen
            to pop its head up night after night from <placeName ref="amb">behind Mr. Sutton’s garden wall</placeName>, to the great
            consternation of passengers along the road, especially of females. In consequence of
            this, an application was made to Mr. Aggs, one of the inspectors of the divisions, who
            proceeded about a quarter past ten at night, to Mr. Sutton’s house, to search for the
            <q>ghost,</q> accompanied by Serjeant Rymer and another constable. Mr. Sutton not being at
            home, they communicated the errand they had come upon to Mr. Warmsley, Mr. Sutton’s
            father-in-law, an elderly gentleman, who (as alleged) gave them permission to search the
            premises. Mr. Aggs then went away, leaving the constables to perform their duty; but
            while they were beating the bushes with their staves in the garden for the ghost, Mr.
            Sutton arrived, and was much displeased at their intrusion, and, as alleged, kicked out
            the lights and assaulted them both, in consequence of which he was taken prisoner to the
            station house. Mr. Sutton denied that the constables ever had permission to search his
            place, and asserted that they had assaulted him, and used him so ill that intended to
            take legal proceedings against them. Mr. Rawlinson, before whom the case was heard,
            dismissed it, without prejudice to either party, and the matter for the time ended.</p>
         <p>Mr. Sutton, in fulfilment of his declaration, a Judge’s warrant against the two
            constables, who were yesterday apprehended upon it and conveyed before Mr. Justice
            Littledale, and at the same time Mr. Aggs, the inspector, was served with two notices of
            action for a trespass—one from Mr. Warmsley, and the other from Mr. Sutton himself.</p>
         <p>Mr. Aggs communicated these facts to Mr. Rawlinson, the sitting magistrate, yesterday,
            and requested his advice upon the subject.</p>
         <p>Mr. Rawlinson said that, as far as he was concerned, he had done with the case.</p>
         <p>Mr. Aggs then asked if Mr. Sutton could demand notice of bail to be given, as in such a
            case it would be extremely inconvenient to have the constables from their duty. As they
            were provided with bail, he hoped they would he immediately liberated.</p>
         <p>Mr. Rawlinson told Mr. Aggs that he did not think such notice requisite.</p>
