         <p>In the Court of Exchequer last week, an action for breach of agreement was brought by
            Mr. Hoffman for furnishing a conjuring apparatus to Professor Herman. Mr. Serjeant
            Simons and Mr. Peter Williams were counsel for the plaintiff. The defendant did not
            appear either in person or by counsel.</p>
         <p>The plaintiff, John William Hoffman, was the inventor of conjuring tricks and optical
            illusions, and the defendant, Professor Gompert Herman, otherwise known as the
            <q>Prestidigitateur,</q> who, some time ago, gave performances at the Princess’s Theatre. In
            September last Mr. Hoffman entered into an agreement in writing to furnish the professor
            with an entirely new trick, which was to produce a ghost, for a sum of 100 guineas, and
            £150 additional for the expense of making the apparatus. The trick was of this nature.
            Professor Herman was to borrow a watch from one of the audience, and to accidentally
            smash it to pieces. While apologising for the mishap a hamper was brought in, and an
            inordinate number of bottles of champagne taken out of it. The audience were treated to
            some champagne, and while the bottles were being replaced, a young Bacchus, in a drunken
            state, jumped out of the hamper. The conjuror attempted to put him in again, but it
            proved far too small; and then came upon the scene the conjuror’s double, in the shape
            of a ghost, which was afterwards converted into a flame. At this flame he fired off a
            pistol containing the remains of the smashed watch, and then there suddenly reappeared
            Bacchus with a perfect watch, which the astonished victim of the trick at once
            recognised as his own. The plaintiff had been put to considerable expense in preparing
            the trick, including the engagement of a lad as a contortionist, who could double up his
            body in a much smaller compass than nature intended; but he had only received about £60.
            The plaintiff applied for the settlement of his claim when he had fulfilled his part of
            the agreement, but the defendant’s fortunes at the Princess’s having declined he
            neglected to pay the money. The present action was brought to recover £136 13s. 9d., for
            which the jury, under the direction of the learned judge, immediately found a
            verdict.</p>
