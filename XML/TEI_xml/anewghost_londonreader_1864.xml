            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from the
               18th and 19th century British newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in metropolitan areas at a time when technology and
               education made reading for pleasure common and inexpensive.</p>

   <p><title>A New <soCalled>Ghost</soCalled>,</title>— <name ref="#kinghn">Mr H. N. King</name>,
      photographer, of <placeName ref="#bath">Bath</placeName>, according to a correspondent, is the inventor and patentee of a
      marvellous <rs ref="ghost">ghost</rs>. In this new invention, <name ref="#kinghn">Mr. King</name> claims superiority in every respect over any
      <soCalled><rs ref="ghost">ghost</rs></soCalled> yet produced. Under his new arrangement he does away with the necessity of ceiling the
      stage, and can introduce any number of figures, each with perfect freedom of action, and
      without the least distortion. In addition to this, the <soCalled><rs ref="ghost">ghosts</rs></soCalled> of an entire set of furniture
      for a room can be shown at once on the stage, every object being clear and distinct. <name ref="#kinghn">Mr. King</name>,
      adds our authority, dispenses entirely with lenses as now used, and has reduced the whole to a
      formula so simple, that a child may with ease and safety work the machinery.</p></body>
