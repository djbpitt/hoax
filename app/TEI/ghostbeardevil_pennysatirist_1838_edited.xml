            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading increasingly common and inexpensive.</p>
            <p>The corpus holds 36 individual documents, which reflect a diverse mix of reporting on
               various hauntings in and around London between 1804 and 1889. The PDF and JPEGs from
               online databases were transcribed using ABBYFineReader OCR, then corrected and
               occasionally manually transcribed if document quality necessitated it. After
               normalization in plain text, all documents were upconverted to TEI XML.</p>

            <normalization>
               <p>Earlier texts have had some spelling normalization due to errors in OCR.
                  Typographic em dashes are longer than modern em dashes, so all dashes have been
                  normalized to modern em dash length.</p>
            </normalization>
            <quotation>
               <p>All extraneous white space used by printers to avoid overlapping with letters has
                  been removed. All quotes are simply tagged with the q tag.</p>

         <p>A ghost, a bear, or a devil—for it seems not to be settled, which—has been going the
            round of <placeName ref="amb">the suburbs of the metropolis</placeName>, frightening
            nursery maids into fits, and ladies into hysterics, and as far as its antics have yet
            been played, with perfect impunity. <placeName ref="#kew">Kew</placeName> is one of the
            places named as the scene of its pranks, probably from the reputation of one of its late
            residents. Had not King Ernest gone to <placeName ref="irr">Hanover</placeName>, never,
            we trust, to come back, we could easily have accounted for the demon's appearance in
            that quarter. —[Satirist].</p>
