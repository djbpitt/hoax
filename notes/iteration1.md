# Iteration 1 Presentation Notes

![cartoon ghostie](ghost.png)

## Is this really iteration one?


No. It's like iteration four or something like that. Some of my thoughts in this presentation are months old. Others I had yesterday.

## What does my capta set look like and how did I get it to look this way?

Short answer: it's 35 documents of varying length collected over the course of a few different classes/projects, all dealing with some sort of ghost story in which one person or group misleads the public.

## Can I see an example?

## Cool, but what exactly is your hypothesis?


>My project will explore the origins of the genre of ghost fiction in 19th-century Britain through the digital Ghost Hoaxes project. I believe that many of the tropes related to plot, class, gender, and race are consistent throughout the century, and can be traced back to the hoaxes and stories that appeared in newspapers and periodicals. In my thesis, I will examine some of the more famous short ghost stories from the mid- to late-19th century and compare their structures and themes with the hoax articles that precede them.


TLDR: I need to see patterns but I want to make them clearer and usable for other people. That means XML documents served up in an XML database.

## But why do this with XML and TEI? Why not just take a lot of notes?

* I want other people to see the documents I have and be able to use them in a similar way I did to answer their research questions. More on that at the [digital workstation](https://pittsburgh-neh-institute.github.io/Institute-Materials-2017/schedule/week_3/digital_workstation.html)
* I like being quick and accurate about things. In a way, markup is an elaborate form of note-taking. But when I need to reference things, I have them closer at hand.
* A digital edition of text meant to be disposable is really interesting to me. Newspaper archives are great, but are Big Data rather than Smart Data. I want this to be a Smart Data version that incorporates historical context and annotation the way an edition of a more "literary" work might.

### But also because...
* Honestly, partially because I'm in somewhat of a cult now.
* I have a fellowship for this and I need neoliberal DH product deliverables!

## Which digital tools are you using?

### Markup
This has already been discussed in some depth

### OCR
This iteration was all about finishing up the OCR and getting ready for markup phase.

### eXist-DB
I have the framework and knowledge of how to make a webapp for this. I may not include this aspect of the project as part of my capta because it's extremely programming heavy (and much of this work may need to happen while I'm on winter break), but it's really how I'm going to answer my question eventually. The capta iterations I do here might only have to do with preparing to answer those questions with the app.

### The TEI
Industry standard, I'm mostly using this because it will look impressive and make me more publicly accessible. It's also a great resource for ensuring I'm following the Best Practices for my field and finding community members who can help me out when I'm in a difficult spot.

### Maps
Another thing I may set aside for the purposes of this class, but my capta is inherently very spatial in a grounded, street-level way. Place is insanely important to haunting and fake haunting alike, so this will be part of the project as soon as I can get my stuff together enough to take it to the lovely people at the Digital Scholarship Commons.

## Mindful Practice reflections

1. Computers are frustrating.
1. I was having an insanely difficult time focusing this summer, and finishing what I felt like was an insurmountable goal all summer was really affirming.
1. I need to be working more modularly going forward.
1. Consistency is hard and I need to do a bit more normalization before I move into full markup mode.
