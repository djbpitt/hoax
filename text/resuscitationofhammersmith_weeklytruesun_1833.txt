RESUSCITATION OF THE HAMMMERSMITH GHOST.

It is in the recollection off  most of our readers that about eight years since much excitement was created by a report that a ghost had appeared to a number of persons in the neighbourhood of Hammersmith, Fulham, &amp;c., several of whom, more particularly females, against whom he appeared to have a great animosity, had been much frightened and ill-treated by him. After continuing his freaks for some time, he became so troublesome that the parochial authorities adopted measures for his apprehension, and after watching for hi for some nights hee was taken in one of the lanes attired in full ghostly costume, and was sent by the magistrates to the House of Correction to undergo a little wholesome discipline for his pranks. Since that time nothing has been heard of his ghostship until about six weeks ago, when he re-appeared in a lane at North-end, and it is reported that he has been seen subsequently in Webb's-lane, Hammersmith, and Acton; but the principal scene of his adventures is stated to be the mad hats in Chiswick-lane, and that the servant of a Mr. Scott was attacked by him there, his assaults, as before, being directed against females. On a Saturday night last it was currently reported that he had been taken by the police at Acton, attired in a large white dress, with long nails or claws, by which hee was eabled to scale walls and hedges for the purpose of making himself scarce, when requisite, and that when brought to the station-house he proved to be a celebrated Captain of sporting notoreity. Several of the inhabitants attended the Hammersmith, $amp;c., Petty Sessions, on Monday, in the hope of obtaining an audience of the spirital [incognito], when it was found that the statement of his apprehension was premature. Another report states him to be dressed in armour, and that he has laid a wager that he will strip the clothes off a certain nuber of females in a given time, and that he has now only one more to strip to win the bet. it is to be hoped that the police will put a stop to the pranks of his ghostship previous to his completing his task, that he may receive a proper reward for his exertions.
