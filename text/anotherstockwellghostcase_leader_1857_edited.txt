Another Stockwell Ghost Case. — A case similar to that of the celebrated Stockwell ghost has led to some proceedings at the Southwark police-court. A working man named Baker, and his wife and daughter, occupied a house in the neighbourhood of London-street, Dockhead, and for some time past the man and woman have been alarmed by singular noises occurring in various parts of the house, and by the breaking of crockery, glass, &amp;c., which were thrown about without any apparent cause. Baker and his wife were greatly scared by these mysteries, and at length spoke to a gentleman connected with the District Visiting Society, who instituted inquiries and soon found out the truth of the matter. The daughter, a girl of twelve, had fallen into bad habits, and, to prevent her wandering about the streets, she was confined to the house. She therefore revenged herself by breaking the crockery-ware; to effect which unperceived, she fastened thin hairs to the dishes, jugs, and glasses, and dexterously jerked them down. She would do this in the presence of her mother, who was so much the victim of superstitious fears, that she never perceived the cause of the effect. Baker himself, when giving evidence before the magistrate, said, that he and his wife had been frightened very much. The girl sullenly admitted what she had done, and said she intended to frighten her parents because they wouldn’t let her go out. She was sent to the House of Correction for fourteen days.
