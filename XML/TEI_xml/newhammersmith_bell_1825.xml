            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading common and inexpensive.</p>

         <p> This personage, who has been styled the<q>Monster,</q> in consequence of his having torn as
            well as frightened divers females, resumed his manly visitations during the recent dark
            nights; but with one exception, he appears to have most carefully avoided his old
            haunts; for the hint was taken, and many persons, attired like women, were on the watch.
            A purse of twenty pounds is stated to have been subscribed for any person who shall
            bring in the ghostly monster dead or alive, of course. On one occasion, the ghost
            knocked at an old woman’s cottage, <placeName ref="#starchgreen amb" 
               >near Starch green, leading to Acton</placeName>. She opened the
            door, when the white-sheeted gentleman presented himself in all the mock horrors of his
            amiable amusement. She fainted away, in consequence, and has since been very ill. On
            another night, he attacked an old woman, passing up <placeName ref="#angellane">Angel-lane</placeName>, where the servant of the
            <placeName ref="#angelpub">Angel public-house</placeName> was so repeatedly attacked, and which servant is even now constantly
            the victim of fits. The old lady had a lantern with her. The ghost came behind her, made
            a groaning noise, tapped at the lantern, &amp;.c.; but she had the presence of mind to
            avoid expressing any fear, pursuing her course, without looking ot the right or to the
            left, and only observing— <q>You would not be base enough to hurt an old woman, would
            you?</q> The ghost continued his tricks, but dame was firm; and when she approached <placeName ref="amb">some
            houses at the end of the lane</placeName>, the fellow retired. A few nights since the apprentice of
            Mr. Hammond, smith, &amp; c., residing <placeName ref="unknown amb">near Webb’s-lane</placeName>, Hammersmith, was passing up a
            lane, <placeName ref="unknown amb">near some newly built houses, leading to the Hammersmith Waterworks</placeName>, close by
            where <emph>Ghosty</emph> jumped upon an old man’s back, and broke his leg, and there the
            apprentice met with the ghost. The apprentice is a spirited lad. The ghost appeared to
            him<q>to rise out of the ground,</q> as he says; but having his thoughts directed to the
            glory of the transaction, and, perhaps, the reward, he boldly attacked the ghost, threw
            at him first the basket of tin goods which he had on his arm, and then seized hold of
            the mantle which the lad says had a silky feel. There was much tugging between them— at
            last Ghosty gave the lad a violent blow on the back of the neck, and laid him sprawling
            in the road, thus disengaging himself, and then hastily decamped. The lad was soon
            afterwards picked up by some neighbouring people, and conveyed home; but he has since
            shown no disposition to go out at night, lest he should again encounter the ghost’s
            strong arm. A man residing in <placeName ref="#hammersmith">Hammersmith</placeName> also came in contact with Ghosty one night,
            and they got struggling for mastery, when Ghosty settled it by giving the man a blow
            which levelled him with the earth, after which the nocturnal agitator was enabled to
            escape. It was rumoured that he had been seized one night at <placeName ref="#kensington">Kensington</placeName>— that he was
            discovered to be a Nobleman’s son, whereupon the matter was<q>hushed up,</q> and that he was
            playing these pranks for a bet, having wagered that he would<q>walk as a ghost</q> for a
            certain number of nights without being taken or <q>laid.</q> If this were true, the capture
            would decide the wager; but unfortunately for its truth, he has since appeared.</p>
