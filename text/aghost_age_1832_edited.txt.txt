A GHOST.-- There is one of the most remarkable personifiations-- if such a term may be allowed-- of a Ghost, in the thsingular story of "The Robber," which has just appeared from the pn of "Blackwood's" well-known contributor. The schemes of the Robber are most ingeniously and naturally contrived to depend, for their fulfillment, almost upon a miracle; and it is the phantom-stratagem which he practices, that most marvelously works out his securityt, and eventually his doom.
