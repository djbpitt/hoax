                <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
                    the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
                    beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
                    education made reading increasingly common and inexpensive.</p>
                <p>The corpus holds 36 individual documents, which reflect a diverse mix of reporting on
                    various hauntings in and around London between 1804 and 1889. The PDF and JPEGs from
                    online databases were transcribed using ABBYFineReader OCR, then corrected and
                    occasionally manually transcribed if document quality necessitated it. After
                    normalization in plain text, all documents were upconverted to TEI XML.</p>

                <normalization>
                    <p>Earlier texts have had some spelling normalization due to errors in OCR.
                        Typographic em dashes are longer than modern em dashes, so all dashes have been
                        normalized to modern em dash length.</p>

                    <p>All extraneous white space used by printers to avoid overlapping with letters has
                        been removed. All quotes are simply tagged with the q tag.</p>

                former, as that is a real calamity; but with regard to the latter affair, we feel

                <p>I have just seen the <rs ref="ghost">ghost walking on the water</rs> under <placeName ref="#londonbridge">London-bridge</placeName>; <rs ref="ghost" type="desc">its breath was
                fire, and when it opened its mouth wide, it had all the appearance of a baker’s
                oven, red hot</rs>. I was terrified lest it should set the Thames on fire, and I could
                not help exclaiming with Shakspeare— <q>The fishes beginning to sweat, Cried, ‘Damn
                it, how hot we shall be!’</q> I was determined, if possible, to give it into custody,
                when all of a sudden <rs ref="ghost" type="desc">I saw it was in the shape of an ass</rs>, and just as the moon went
                behind a cloud it vanished. I have to request that you will give me your opinion on
                this important matter.</p>

                    <rs ref="ghost">It is not true that I have been personating the ghost which has thrown so many

                certainly bring the affair before the Parliament, as superstitions feelings tend
                greatly to impede the march of intellect, and particularly militate against any
                system of national education. <rs ref="ghost">The ubiquity of the ghost is truly marvellous</rs>, being
                seen at different places at the same moment; and it is well known that I never was

                <p>As the story about the ghost is likely to injure my reputation considerably, I
                entreat of you to undeceive the public mind. The only ghost worthy of attention is
                the one I represent in the tragedy of Ham-let; mine is the only legitimate ghost
                ex{}ant, and I consider the attempt which is made to impose upon the world, as
                dictated by hatred and malice. I rely upon your candour and impartiality to render
                me this act of justice, and beg to enclose an admission to the shilling gallery, as
                I am seen to the best advantage at the greatest possible
                distance.</p>

                <p>I am compelled to apply to you for consolation at
                this distressing moment: my tabby has miscarried owing to her being frightened by
                the ghost. Seven little dear kittens, and one a real tortoise-shell Tom, deprived of
                existence so prematurely! My poor Tabby was gently caterwauling, when the ghost came
                in the shape of a huge dog, and bitoff half of her tail; her condition is
                deplorable, but I am in hopes that I shall be able to restore that graceful
                appendage to its proper length. Do lay the perturbed spirit if you possibly can, or
                the most serious results may be expected. I have just heard of the following. An
                elderly lady of my acquaintance was suddenly embraced by it in the shape of a
                Life-guardsman, and her teeth chattered so much from fear that they all dropped out.
                Her dentist declares that he must make her another new set. A servant girl in my
                neighbourhood went out on an errand on Sunday night, and did not return home till
                Monday morning, when she told a most lamentable story about being carried off
                against her will by the ghost, and how she was detained by it all the night, and how
                it seemed to oppress her like the nightmare, but would not let her sleep. The girl
                further says, that the ghost has a spell over her, and that it is likely she shall
                see it again. I have sent a worthy divine, <q>a powerful preacher,</q> to afford her
                truly spiritual consolation. I have heard of something else which was told to my
                informant by a person who saw a little boy who had spoken to an elderly woman that
                thought she had had a glimpse of the ghost. I am making every inquiry possible, and
                if I meet with the elderly woman, I will accompany her to communicate all she knows
                and thinks, and thinks that she knows, I send you a present of one of my dear
                kittens stuffed.</p>

                <p>We hasten to give a place to the following from the M-P-ric of <placeName>Finsbury</placeName>:—</p>

                    <opener>
                        <salute>Dear Sat—</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>An absurd report having got abroad that I am the ghost,
                or devil, monster, or whatever it may be died, by which the suburbs of London are
                reported to be haunted, I shall feel obliged by your giving a contradiction to the
                same. I am neither ghost nor demon, although a devil of a fellow for moral and
                medical dissection; nor have I been playing any pranks lately, except in the House
                of Common and at <placeName ref="WCHouse">White Conduit House</placeName>. I never wear a bear-skin dress, nor array
                myself in a white sheet to frighten nursery girls out of their senses; nor was I
                seen in <soCalled>
                            <placeName ref="CTLane">Cut-throat Lane</placeName>
                        </soCalled> the other evening, clawing the clothes off the backs of
                several females, as reported in the papers. It if true that many years back I cut
                off the head of Thistlewood after his execution, having figured as <q>the man in the
                mask</q> on the scaffold. But, my dear Sat, I submit that this trifling circumstance
                forms no excuse for my being held up as the <soCalled>monster</soCalled> who has frightened the suburbs
                from their propriety. Pray set the public right on this point, as I am peculiarly
                nice on matters that affect my character. I send you a box of <rs ref="rel">Lucifer</rs>, forgetting an
                instantaneous light, manufactured by myself, and I think you will allow them to
                evince no small acquaintance with the science of chemistry and
                combustion.</p>
