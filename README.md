# London ghost hoaxes in eighteenth and nineteenth century news media
## a development repository managed by Gabi Keane

This project uses the TEI guidelines to digitize and encode a collection of PDF and JPG files collected from various databases. These images are subject to copyright, but their contents are not, thus the private development repository.

### project goals

#### create a sustainable ***digital workstation***
* searchable, well-linked and researched resource that traces allusions, references, and context of stories
* contextualize stories with cultural and technological information

#### visualize the way information moves
* encode geographic and personal data for those writing, publishing, and referenced
* map that, both geographically and possibly with network analysis

#### track thematic elements in stories
* encode ideas about justice/punishment, lying/misinformation, rapping/mediums, political, religious, and Orientalist themes
* explore the possibility of using topic modeling

#### draw conclusions 
* about origins and implications of presenting 'hoaxes' without/with skeptical attitudes on broader cultural movement
* about connections between newsprint/periodical writing and the popular literature of the later 19th century, specifically regarding the move toward skeptical, logical protagonists
