            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading common and inexpensive.</p>

         <p>A Ghost

There is one of the most remarkable personifiations-- if such a term may be allowed-- of a Ghost, in the thsingular story of "The Robber," which has just appeared from the pn of "Blackwood's" well-known contributor. The schemes of the Robber are most ingeniously and naturally contrived to depend, for their fulfillment, almost upon a miracle; and it is the phantom-stratagem which he practices, that most marvelously works out his securityt, and eventually his doom.</p>
