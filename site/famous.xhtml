            <h2>The Cock-Lane ghost, or Scratching Fanny</h2>
            <p>In Douglas Grant’s history <em>The Cock-Lane Ghost</em>, the story is related and
                explored as somewhat of a myth or legend, and indeed the story has remained relevant
                even today. Though the hoax event takes place during the eighteenth century, the
                story was revived during the nineteenth century with the “rediscovery” of Scratching
                Fanny’s corpse. While the details of many of the hoaxes I have collected are
                uninteresting, the popularity and persistence of this story relate to its morbidity
                and scandal, and are thus relevant to any analysis of it as a cultural object.</p>
            <p>1759 saw the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Kent, a couple expecting a child, at Cock-Lane
                after separating from their previous landlord under extenuating circumstances. After
                the death of his first wife Elizabeth, William Kent had fallen in love with her
                sister, Fanny, and the two moved to London and attempted to pass as a married
                couple. Such marriages were prohibited at the time, though the two had made wills to
                include the other “[a]s a proof of their constancy and sincerity,” akin to the
                commitment of marriage (Grant 8). The legality of their partnership drew scrutiny
                from her family, and though there’s no proof their previous landlord had known about
                the situation, Grant speculates this had a hand in their need to move.</p>
            <p>The pair had found their new home after meeting Richard Parsons, who owned the house
                on Cock-Lane, at church, and they moved in shortly after. Parsons seems to have
                learned of the couple’s situation and began taking advantage of it much as the
                previous landlord had, by borrowing money from Kent and refusing to repay, assuming
                he wouldn’t want to take the risk of involving authorities. Around the same time, a
                very pregnant Fanny began to complain of scratching noises in the night,
                particularly when sleeping in the same room as Elizabeth Parsons, Richard’s
                daughter. It was reported that the family had also seen a ghostly figure, who they
                supposed to be Elizabeth, Kent’s deceased wife.</p>
            <p>After moving out of the house on Cock-Lane, Fanny fell ill and passed away,
                supposedly of smallpox, but the scratching at Cock-Lane persisted. After her death,
                the noises were investigated, and the conclusion drawn that the new ghost must be
                that of Fanny. Such diagnosis, argues Grant, may have been a result of early
                Methodists’ proclivity to “deliberately [play] upon the credulity and [encourage]
                superstition in order to prove that the spiritual lay immediately to hand” (Grant
                21). The origin of the myth, having little to do with any significant association
                between the deceased and the home she lived in for mere months, can be attributed to
                the neighborhood gossip, which ascribed “her illness as a visitation of God upon
                sinners” (Grant 14). With the help of Reverend Moore, a colleague of the pastor who
                had been present at Fanny’s death, Parsons drew from the ghost that she had been
                poisoned by her husband. Such an accusation, though not supported by Moore,
                motivated Kent to attend a séance at Cock-Lane. As the ghost was sensitive to
                Elizabeth Parsons, the girl was put to bed and the questions began. The ghost was
                questioned—and ultimately damned Kent to hanging for her murder.</p>
            <p>The popularity of the story led to a series of séances, attempts to discredit the
                ghost, and newspaper stories. Being that eighteenth-century media had not yet seen
                the development of industrialization, the story was rather limited as compared to
                later runs. That being said, “newspapers reported that the injudicious trumpeting of
                the story had caused such terror in a ladies’ boarding school that the younger
                children had been frightened to go up the stairs… similar terror reigned in private
                families” (Grant 51). As the story escalated, various attempts to disprove the ghost
                and catch Elizabeth Parsons in the act of scratching or tapping continued. As with
                many spirit rapping stories, closer inspection was reason for the ghost to become
                frightened and disappear, so conclusive evidence could not be found out either way.
                Parsons guarded his daughter from much of the scrutiny, though out of fear of
                discovery or concern for the child was up for debate. After such tests as extreme as
                tying Elizabeth up and having her sleep in a hammock, it was concluded that the
                child was the one making the noises when a servant observed her getting out of bed
                and taking a board from the fireplace with which to make the noises.</p>
            <p>The subsequent court case, in which Kent tried to clear his name, resulted in the
                imprisonment of the Parsons. The story became popular before the court case as well,
                inspiring a series of stories entitled <em>The Ghost</em>, along with songs and
                poetry.</p>
            <p>Grant notes in his introduction that the story remained strong in cultural memory
                well into the nineteenth century, when J.W. Archer discovers the body while
                attempting to sketch some Gothic architecture (Grant 1). Archer, then, is
                responsible for concluding that the corpse’s features are “adipocere” (a sign of
                arsenic poisoning) and free of the mark of smallpox in John Timbs’s 1867 book <a
                    href="https://archive.org/details/curiositiesoflon00timbiala">Curiosities of
                    London</a>(Remarkable). Though this conclusion clashes with narrative presented
                by Grant, it added a new level of public interest to a story that was over a century
                old. Whether the body Archer saw was really that of Fanny Kent is disputable, as
                Grant claims that Kent did have the coffin inscribed. The nineteenth century
                periodical article in which I first discovered the Cock-Lane Ghost story relates it
                to provide context for the spirit rapping events that became popular with the rise
                of Victorian spiritualism. Though media coverage at the time of the event existed,
                the effects of media were not so viral as common word of mouth. The technology to
                create viral media simply did not exist before 1814, but this hoax event does
                establish a solid legend and tradition against which viral stories and hoaxes were
                often measured.</p>

            <h2>Spring-heeled Jack</h2>
            <img src="police_times_1838.jpg" alt="Image of January 1838 Times clipping" />
            <p>The legend of Spring-heeled Jack is a somewhat more diffuse hoax: historian Karl Bell
                credits its birth with a January 1838 publication of a letter to the Lord Mayor in
                    <em>The Times</em>, and then slowly spreads from London to the counties over the
                course of 30 years (Bell 1). The initial publication in the Times is a reprinting of
                a letter from a Peckham resident to the Mayor, expressing concern for the welfare of
                the young ladies in the community. The attacker, whom the writer thinks is of “the
                higher ranks of life,” had taken up the costumes of “a ghost, a bear, and a devil”
                to frighten young women (Police). In his response, the Mayor invites the writer,
                presumed to be a woman, to give an actual description of the attacker so they might
                “…catch him, in spite of the paid press and police” (Police).</p>
            <p>Throughout his career as urban legend and haunt, Spring-heeled Jack changed and
                traveled significantly. Bell notes that though he began as urban legend, the
                character “went on to become a penny serial character, the focus of theatrical
                plays, ballets and dioramas, and a nursery bogeyman… before diffusing into Victorian
                culture to such a degree as to become an expression associated with swiftness,
                elusiveness or the inexplicable” (Bell 2). That elusiveness made for an interesting
                story, needing little more than a single witness. The first reports in September
                1837 did not attract media attention, likely because they were outside of central
                London. As the ghost moved closer to city center, it transformed from a bull to a
                bear, and media began reporting on attacks. As reports and attacks continued
                throughout 1838, reports shifted to include a group of pranksters, rather than just
                one.</p>
            <p>Bell argues that the January 1838 publication of the story in The Times shifted the
                pranks from local superstition to something Londoners from all classes and social
                groups concerned themselves with. “Respectable newspapers” took the story “as just
                another example of lingering popular superstition and credulity,” while other
                publications jumped on the opportunity to publish something the public could engage
                with. The attitudes of <em>The Times</em>, the Mayor, and “London’s broadsheet
                press” looked upon the story with bemusement and inconvenience, but readers did not
                see it that way (Bell 22). The uptick in reported sightings and attacks after January 1838
                proved the public’s investment.</p>
            <p>While the invention of Spring-heeled Jack as an urban legend can be counted on
                regardless of media involvement, the publication of the story propelled it
                significantly. This case, unlike the Cock-Lane Ghost, was never meant to incite
                public interest, and instead was addressed by the Mayor in an almost mocking tone.
                The issues of gender and class are particularly salient regarding Jack, as those
                behind the pranks were supposed to be wealthy young men, and their victims young
                women of lower and middle class families. Bell asserts that this supposition
                “reflected a contemporary prejudice against the aristocracy by both the middling and
                laboring classes” (Bell 100). Conversely, the Mayor’s and <em>The Times</em>’ attitude toward
                the initial letter betrayed a disdain for the foolishness of women, particularly
                women outside of elite social classes, that led to an explosion of attacks and
                reports. Media also used these stories to reinforce the emergent middle class’s
                social status, as they associated superstition with ignorance. Belief in
                Spring-heeled Jack was regarded as a lower-class attitude, bereft of the reasoning
                and knowledge of an enlightened individual (Bell 107). Ultimately, upper and
                middle-class men maintained influence over the Spring-heeled Jack narrative in print
                media.</p>
