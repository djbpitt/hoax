            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading common and inexpensive.</p>

         <p>﻿Notwithstanding our repeated publications of the documents upon which our details respecting the St. James’s Park Ghost were founded, still certain Prints continue to charge us with having fabricated the story. We do not pretend to “take the Ghost’s word” against reason and philosophy, at the same time we thought it our duty to enquire into the foundation of the rumours, which had for so many days played upon the public credulity, and to state the result of our enquiries on the subject, which, we flatter ourselves, have proved as satisfactory as the nature of the business would admit.

A Morning Print asserts, “that some papers” (we confess we are at a loss to know which) “very candidly confess, that the abilities of their employers are not above the common level; but they still continue to assert their integrity and good intention.” Of the [employers] of the Paper in question, we believe, no person will be mad enough to assert, that they have either [good abilities], or good [intentions].
