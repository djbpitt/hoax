         <p>﻿A Ghost Caught

The mystery of the ghost of an old house called Drumhead, which has kept the village and neighbourhood of Cardross in a state of great excitement for several weeks past, has at length been revealed. To such an extent had the rumours prevailed of the inexplicable sounds heard at night by the inhabitants of the house, and numbers having left it to reside in the village out of terror, that, in order to restore peace to the district, the constable stationed there determined to investigate into the cause of the affair. One night, between eleven and twelve o’clock, he proceeded to Drumhead, with three other young men belonging to Cardross to assist him in his researches, the result of which was, as might have been expected, that the whole mystery was the work of some of the workmen lodging in the house, who had concocted the trick for the purpose of alarming the other inhabitants. A careful search was made. At last they opened a door in a dark passage leading from the kitchen to the room, and which concealed a recess beneath a staircase conducting to the second storey, and in a few minutes the mystery of the ghost was exploded. They found in the recess an old copper boiler, which had lain there apparently a number of years. A large square board was lying on the ground, like a trap-door to some vault below; but the machinery by which the spirit-rapping had been applied was revealed. It consisted of a strong species of dried grass, capable of much resistance, which was conveyed beneath the floor to some distant apartment of the house. To this was attached two wands and the leg of a pair of tongs, so ingeniously constructed that by pulling the line the leg of the tongs was made to strike or rub against the copper boiler so as produce a variety of sounds. The wands and iron could be removed, and nothing would remain but the end of the line, which no one would readily notice. The discovery of the whole plot has exasperated the ghost party to such a degree that the constable believes there is some danger of a serious breach af the peace.</p>
