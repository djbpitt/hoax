            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading common and inexpensive.</p>

         <p>﻿Tom Paine's Ghost

A few nights since the bellowing wind with a hollow roar marched up Fetter-lane, convulsing the casements of each second floor! Not a light was seen, except the gas; the stars were fast asleep and covered over with the clothes of heaven! the dark thick fog had put out the moon, and quite obscured that varied nothing some call sky! St. Paul’s was snoring twelve, the helpless guardians tried locks, bolts, and bars, yawning the hour as they had it from their tall fat friend, and Somnus had just walked his drowsy cap over the evil eyes of “a labourer in St. Dunstan’s,” when lo! a sprite appeared! the ghost of Tommy Paine! “Spirit of radicalism, arise!” said Grimmy. “Avaunt!” cried Twopenny Trash, seizing a gridiron, “quit my sight! thy bones are marrowless, for I had the boiling of ’em and ought to know, but,” added he, recollecting his sacrilege in America, “What would your gracious figure?”—“Unhallowed grubber of dead men’s bones,” quoth Grimmy, “author of all that is rank and nasty! lend me thine cars! Mark me! instantly arise, doff thy red night cap, and fix fast in thine artificial ivories! List! but soft, methinks I scent thy hopeful heir; brief let me be. Thou knowest that in Canada thy corn is never planted, therefore never reaped; thy writings too arc by all emigrants contemned, therefore keep the rebels here; petition the House against this emigration; draw it up this very night: and as you did the man when Mayor, some good, why put it in the hands of Matthew Wood!” Up rose the lecturer, on went his breeks, inspired by the spirit lie groped about for his lucifers in order to find himself, which done, he set to work, completed his task, sent it to Wood, who presented it from the “wonderful and astonishing” writer! It was rejected! and yesterday on the “gridiron” ’twas cooked, and garnished with peculiar spleen!</p>
